# 2nd_Iteration
This repo includes the code for training and testing YOLO v8 on the dataset we have (Deer, Badger, Hare, Fox)

train.py --> The code here splits the labelled dataset randomly into training and validation datasets, then it trains the model using YOLO v8n with parameters (epochs=50, batch=9)
